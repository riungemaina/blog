If you have below two hundred dollars to buy a laptop, which one should you go for? The options here are limited as the price too is low. In the used market, you can negotiate a killer deal but the stakes are too high, it is usually a hit-or-miss game. The used market too is likely to be crowded with older technologies. That being said, we will only look at those laptops that you can buy new at below the two hundred dollar mark with a potential to stress to two hundred and fifty on the higher end.

### **Acer Aspire 1**

The Acer Aspire 1 is a fantastic budget laptop that comes in well under the $250 mark. Despite its low price, it boasts a 15.6-inch HD display, which is great for multimedia and work. It's powered by an Intel Celeron N4000 processor and 4GB of RAM, providing enough power for everyday tasks like web browsing and document editing. The laptop also has a decent battery life, making it a reliable companion for on-the-go use.

### **HP Stream 14**

The HP Stream 14 is an excellent choice for those who prioritize portability and online connectivity. It comes with a 14-inch HD display, an Intel Celeron N4000 processor, and 4GB of RAM. What sets this laptop apart is the inclusion of 1TB of OneDrive cloud storage and a one-year subscription to Microsoft Office 365. These additions make it an attractive option for students and professionals who rely heavily on Microsoft software.

### **Samsung Chromebook 3**

For those who mainly use their laptops for web browsing and online tasks, the Samsung Chromebook 3 is a top choice. It runs on Chrome OS, which is known for its speed and simplicity. With an Intel Celeron N3060 processor and 4GB of RAM, it handles web-based applications with ease. Its 11.6-inch display and compact design make it highly portable, and the battery life can last through a full day of use.

### **Lenovo Ideapad 1**

Lenovo Ideapad 1 is another strong contender in the sub-$250 laptop category. It offers a lightweight and compact design, making it perfect for students and travellers. With its AMD A6 processor and 4GB of RAM, it handles multitasking reasonably well. The 14-inch HD display and surprisingly comfortable keyboard add to the overall value of this laptop.

### **ASUS VivoBook L203MA**

The ASUS VivoBook L203MA is a compact and lightweight laptop with an 11.6-inch HD display. Its Intel Celeron N4000 processor and 4GB of RAM provide adequate power for basic tasks. This laptop's standout feature is its impressive battery life, making it an ideal choice for long flights or all-day work or study sessions. Its price point also makes it an attractive option for budget-conscious shoppers.

You should not ask for the most with these machines but with the same budget, a look at the used market may result in a better deal.
